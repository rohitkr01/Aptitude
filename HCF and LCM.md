## **HCF**

The greatest number which divides each of the two or more numbers is called HCF or
Highest Common Factor. Also called the **greatest common divisor (GCD**).

### Methods to find HCF :

1. **By Prime factorization method:** \
i) Write prime factors of the given numbers. \
ii) Write prime factors which are common to both. \
iii) And products of the common factors will give you HCF of the numbers.

<pre>
Example: Find the HCF of  24 & 36.
  Step 1: Write prime factors of the given numbers.
          24 = 2 √ó 2 √ó 2√ó 3
          36 = 2√ó 2√ó 3 √ó 3
  Step 2: Write prime factors which are common to 24 & 36. ‚Üí 2,2&3
  Step 3: Products of the common factors are 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 = 12

  Hence, HCF = 12. |
</pre>

2. **By division method:**   \
If we were given two numbers, then  \
i) Divide the large number by a small number.  \
ii) If the remainder is left, then divide the first divisor by remainder.   \
iii) If the remainder divides the first divisor completely, then it is the HCF.   \
iv) If the remainder does not divide the first divisor completely, then repeat the
steps.

  Example: Find HCF of 300 and 396.

Hence HCF is12.

3. **Difference Method** 
 
  Step1: For finding the HCF of numbers, take the differences between the numbers. 
  Step2: Here, many differences are possible, but you have to choose the smallest difference between any pair of these numbers.  \
  Step3 : Write the factors of that number and the HCF of all these numbers would  be the highest number from the factor list which divides all numbers 
 
<pre>
Example:  HCF of 4,16 and 22    <br> 
       Step1: Difference between numbers   
              16-4 = 12  , 22-16 = 6 ,22-4 = 18
       Step2: Choosing smallest difference 
              6
       Step3: Factors of 6 are 6 ,3 ,2 & 1 
       Step4: 6‚Üí Does Not divide 22 and 4, so this is not HCF 
           3‚Üí  Does Not divide 22,16and 4, so this is not HCF   
           2‚ÜíDivide all three so this is the HCF    
           
        Hence, HCF=2 
</pre>

## **LCM**

**Least Common Multiple**(LCM) is a method to find the smallest common multiple
between any two or more numbers.

### Method to find LCM:

1. **By prime factorization:**   \
Step1: Find the prime factor of two numbers a & b.   \
Step2: Write all the prime factors that appear at least once in the numbers a & b.   \
Step3: Write all the prime factors with their highest power.   \
Step4: Products of all the prime factors with their highest power will give you LCM.

Shortcut for LCM:

When the numbers are **co-prime**, then LCM is simply their product.
So, 7, 9 and 11 are co-prime, The LCM is 7 √ó 9 √ó 11.

**Co-prime Number**: Two numbers are Co-prime to each other when they have no
the common factor among each other.

````
Example: Let's have two numbers 12 & 80.
Step1: List the prime factors
        12=2 √ó 2 √ó 3
        80=2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 5
Step2: Write all the prime factors that appear, at least once in the numbers:
        2,3,5.
Step3: Write all the prime factors with their highest power: ‚Åç
Step4: The LCM = ‚Åç=240

 Note :

- **LCM has to be the multiple of HCF**
- **Product of two numbers (ùëé √ó ùëè) = ùêøùê∂ùëÄ √ó ùêªùê∂ùêπ
(**this formula is valid for two numbers**)**
- The least number when divided by a, b and c, leaves the same remainder ‚Äòr‚Äô in each case will be equal to **LCM(a, b,c)+r**
- The least number, when divided by a , b and c, leaves remainder p, q and r respectively such that a-p=b-q=c-r=k will be equal to **LCM(a, b, c)-k**
- The greatest number when divided by a, b and c, leaves the same remainder ‚Äòr‚Äô in each case will be equal to **HCF( a ~b, b ~c, c ~a)**
- The greatest number, when divided by a, b and c, leaves remainder p, q and r respectively will be **HCF(a-p, b-q, c-r)**

## EXAMPLES

1. Example: Find the HCF of 150 & 375.    \

        Step 2: Write down the prime factors which are common to 150 & 375.
                3,5 & 5.    
        Step 3: Products of the common factors are 3 √ó 5 √ó 5

      Hence, HCF = 75.

<pre>
Solution: Divide 120 by 100.
          120/100 ‚Üí 1 and remainder is 20
          
          Now, divide the first divisor 100 by the first remainder 20
          
          100/20 ‚Üí 5 and remainder is 0.

<pre>
Solution:   50-38=12, factor of 12 are 12,6,4,3,2&1.

            12 ‚ÜíDoes Not divide 38, so this is not HCF of these two numbers.

            6‚ÜíDoes Not divide 38, so this is not HCF of these two numbers.

            4 ‚ÜíDoes Not divide 38, so this is not HCF of these two numbers.

            3 ‚ÜíDoes Not divide 38, so this is not HCF of these two numbers.

            2 ‚ÜíDivide 38, so this is the HCF of these two number
</pre>
4. Example: LCM & HCF of 1/2 ,5/7 and 8/11 are: \
Answer: LCM= 40/1
<pre>
    HCF= 1/(2 x 7x 11)

    Solution: LCM = LCM(1,5,8) / HCF(2,7,11)

    HCF = HCF(1,5,8) / LCM(2,7,11)

    So, LCM= 40/1

    HCF= 1/(2 √ó 7 √ó 11)

5. Example: Six bells commence tolling together and toll at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8 10 and
12 seconds respectively. In 30 minutes, how many times do they toll together? \
a) 4
b) 10
c) 15
d) 16
\
Answer: d) 16
<pre>
Solution:   L.C.M. of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 is 120.

So, the bells will toll together after every 120 seconds(2 minutes).

In 30 minutes, they will toll together (30/2)+1 16 times.

6. The LCM and HCF of the two numbers are 300 and 30 respectively. If one of the numbers is divided by 4 the quotient is 15, then what is the other number?  \
  Answer:150
<pre>
Solution: LCM = 300

  HCF = 30

  let numbers be x and y

  x/4 =15 (as per question says)

  so, x=60

  Using **Product of two numbers (ùëé √ó ùëè) = ùêøùê∂ùëÄ √ó ùêªùê∂ùêπ**

       $x*y = 300*30$

      $y=9000/60$

      $y=150$
</pre>

7. Find the smallest number which gives the remainder 5, when divided by any of the numbers 8, 12 and 15. \

      a)120

      b)240

      c)125

      d)65
\
      Answer: c)125
<pre>
      Solution: 

      **The least number when divided by a, b and c, leaves the same remainder ‚Äòr‚Äô in each case will**    

      **be equal to LCM(a, b ,c)+r** 

      Therefore smallest number = LCM(8,12 and 15)+5

      Now task is find LCM of 8,12 and 15 

      Factors of 8 = 2x2x2

                12=2x2x3

                15=3x5

     LCM = $2^3*3^1*5^1$=120

     Hence number is 120+5 =125.
</pre>

8.What is the smallest number which when divided by 16 , 20 and 25 leaves remainder 7,11 and 16 respectively?  \
   Answer : 391
<pre>
 Solution : 
    The least number when divided by a, b and c leaves remainder p, q and r respectively                                  
    
    such that a-p=b-q=c-r=k will be equal to **LCM(a, b, c)-k**
        16-7 =9

        20-11=9

        25-16=9
        
    so, k =9 here and number will be LCM(16,20,25) - k = 400-9 =391
</pre>

   Answer: 16
   <pre>
      Solution: Here a=65 , b=81 and c=145

      Greatest number will be HCF(65 ~81 , 81 ~145 , 145 ~65) = HCF(16,64,80) =16
  </pre>
  
10. What is the greatest number which when divided by 68, 59 and 43 leaves the remainder 8,9 and 3 respectively? <br>
    Answer: 10
  <pre>
       Solution: Here a=68 , b=59 and c=43

       p = 8 , q=9 and r=3 

       Greatest number = HCF(a-p , b-q , c-r)=HCF(68-8,59-9,43-3)=HCF(60,50,40)=10
